# BasketballHofTeams

Welcome. Here you may learn more about the teams in the Basketball Hall of Fame! 

Though there are hundreds of players and coaches in the Hall of Fame, very few teams are bestowed this honor.
I created this gem so that people can learn why these teams stood out.

## Installation

Because this gem hasn't been published, you'll have to clone it by typing in your terminal:

`git clone git@github.com:morganpstanley/basketball_hof_teams.git`

That should clone it onto your computer.
Then type 

`cd basketball_hof_teams`

to jump into the directory, and finally type in

`ruby bin/basketball_hof_teams`

to run the program.

## Usage

To use the gem, first use the above directions to get it running on your machine. After a list of teams pops up, type in the number to the left of any team to learn more about that team. Then, when prompted, either type in 'y' to go back and look at other teams, or 'n' to exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
